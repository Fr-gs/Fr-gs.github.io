The script will run on page load and pick a random integer from 0 to
the the list size. It will then use that number to build a path to an
image. Set the number of your list size. Set the correct path to the folder
where the images are located. Name the images all the same thing except
for an incrementing number at the end of the base filename proceeding
the period (ex. frog23.jpg). Make sure all the file extensions are the same.
Set the correct file extension.
